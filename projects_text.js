  ["Study of Magnetic Confinement of Plasma Rings",
  /*WRITE HERE PROJECT TEXT*/
    `Between September 2015 and July 2016 I did some research on
    Plasma Physics, at Leiden University. This project consisted in the
    attempt to visualize the theoretical prediction of magnetic fields 
    in plasma with toroidal shapes. The studied plasma was a Laser
    Induced Plasma on a Helium chamber. For this I had to use
    multiple visualisation techniques such as Faraday Rotation, 
    Interferometry and Spectroscopy. Through out this study many 
    other questions raised regarding the origin itself of these rings, 
    which provided the material for a study of the hydrodynamical effects 
    of the initial stage of the laser induced plasma.During this project 
    I developed many skills on electronics, programming, image analysis and 
    abstract mathematics.`,

  /*WRITE HERE PROJECT TEXT*/
    `In 2014 I worked for 6 moths as a part time student 
    worker in the Leonardo Da Vinci Center for Bionics, in
    the Technical University of Munich. I did some research
    for a project that intended to explain the Chain Fountain 
    phenomena – this is an interesting mechanical phenomena that
    happens when the tail of a beam chain is thrown out of a 
    bucket and its fall creates a lift in the remaining chain 
    body. Due to its strange layout and its possible applications
    in aerospace engineering, I was commissioned a numerical study
    to confirm the theoretical mechanical approach. For this I had 
    to study some numerical methods and multi-body simulation methods.Also
    , in parallel I developed an interpretation using the Fluid Mechanics
    approach, treating the chain as running fluid pipe.It was a very 
    insightful work that allowed me to develop some insight on numerical 
    methods and its challenges.`,

  'Wave Synthesiser':

  ["Design of a Wave Synthesiser for a Laser Pulse.",
  /*WRITE HERE PROJECT TEXT*/
    `In 2015 I work as an assistant student at the Max Planck 
    Institute for Quantum Optics, in Munich. My work was to design 
    an efficient layout for a phase matching synthesiser. To produce
    an ultra short pulse, a continuous frequency spectrum was achieved,
    and to match the out coming wave phase, the spectrum was divided into
    two beams that would go through different phase delay channels. At the 
    end both channels would be combined to achieve the final pulse, combined
    both in space and time. This work was done under the supervision of Dr. Martin Shultze.`

    'Portugal China Relations': 
  /*WRITE HERE PROJECT SUBTITLE*/
  ["Trading Platform between Portuguese Speaking Countries and China",
  /*WRITE HERE PROJECT TEXT*/
    `During the year of 2017 I worked between China 
    and Portugal developing commercial and diplomatic 
    relations between both countries. With AJEPC – Portugal 
    China Young Entrepreneurs Association – I travelled through 
    the main cities of China in to attend events and meeting that 
    would enhance the image of Portugal in China. From all these 
    trips I can highlight a 3 months mission I did in Chongqing, 
    where I organised a cultural event that intended to show the 
    Portuguese culture to the city.

It was a very enlightening experience in the overall, since I truly 
experienced the cultural shock on a work environment and on a daily 
routine. It helped me to conceptualise the world on a truly global frame 
and to understand better its economic dynamics.

Also, while in chongqing I developed a Market study about that Municipality, 
exploring its pros and cons for enterprises that want to expand to one of the 
fastest urban commercial regions in the world.`,

`In 2013 I worked for 3 months in the Solid State Laboratory 
of the Instituto Superior Técnico doing the automation of the 
experimental set-up. My work consisted on the construction of 
automated rotation stage and a data acquisition system. This work 
involved setting up transducers and a control system (using microprocessors 
and some integrated circuits). This work gave me a lot insight into 
computer external communications and the implementation of amplification 
circuits and relay circuits.`,
