  ["Study of Magnetic Confinement of Plasma Rings",
  /*WRITE HERE PROJECT TEXT*/
    `Between September 2015 and July 2016 I did some research on
    Plasma Physics, at Leiden University. This project consisted in the
    attempt to visualize the theoretical prediction of magnetic fields 
    in plasma with toroidal shapes. The studied plasma was a Laser
    Induced Plasma on a Helium chamber. For this I had to use
    multiple visualisation techniques such as Faraday Rotation, 
    Interferometry and Spectroscopy. Through out this study many 
    other questions raised regarding the origin itself of these rings, 
    which provided the material for a study of the hydrodynamical effects 
    of the initial stage of the laser induced plasma.During this project 
    I developed many skills on electronics, programming, image analysis and 
    abstract mathematics.`,

  ["Numerical Simulation of Chain Fountain",
  /*WRITE HERE PROJECT TEXT*/
    `In 2014 I worked for 6 moths as a part time student 
    worker in the Leonardo Da Vinci Center for Bionics, in
    the Technical University of Munich. I did some research
    for a project that intended to explain the Chain Fountain 
    phenomena – this is an interesting mechanical phenomena that
    happens when the tail of a beam chain is thrown out of a 
    bucket and its fall creates a lift in the remaining chain 
    body. Due to its strange layout and its possible applications
    in aerospace engineering, I was commissioned a numerical study
    to confirm the theoretical mechanical approach. For this I had 
    to study some numerical methods and multi-body simulation methods.Also
    , in parallel I developed an interpretation using the Fluid Mechanics
    approach, treating the chain as running fluid pipe.It was a very 
    insightful work that allowed me to develop some insight on numerical 
    methods and its challenges.`,

  ["Design of a Wave Synthesiser for a Laser Pulse.",
  /*WRITE HERE PROJECT TEXT*/
    `In 2015 I work as an assistant student at the Max Planck 
    Institute for Quantum Optics, in Munich. My work was to design 
    an efficient layout for a phase matching synthesiser. To produce
    an ultra short pulse, a continuous frequency spectrum was achieved,
    and to match the out coming wave phase, the spectrum was divided into
    two beams that would go through different phase delay channels. At the 
    end both channels would be combined to achieve the final pulse, combined
    both in space and time. This work was done under the supervision of Dr. Martin Shultze.`
